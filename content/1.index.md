This is my personally hosted blog and will be a continous work in progress, its purpose is to document my learning journey, what I am doing and to share my thoughts on software development and  other related topics. To put things in perspective, I have been associated with tech in one shape, kind or form for the last 20 years. I having been a trained computer technician among other things before being a software developer.

I am currently taking time become more competent in  JavaScript ( React, Vue and the MERN Stack), Learning Tools and creating value added technical solutions. I have also taken time grow as a tech speaker as well in order to grow professionally.

My strengths include problem solving, the ability to modify codebases, ability to work with multiple stakeholders to ensure that the work being done is understood and the expected solutions are delivered. Additional skills experience include: simplified documentation, quality assurance, and test strategies. In the past year (2022 to current), I have taken time recently to start speaking on topics I know and have been learning more on. I have spoken at [MagnoliaJS, Refactr and ConnectTech](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGnY7AR_74ENDGunY0tewSTY1q2a6Q6rB&si=4FZnryyV-114O_Db) to name a few.
